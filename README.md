## Ready for Hacktober event


Please do not hound Open Source maintainers with silly pull requests, that is what this repository is for. I know, I know, you want that snazzy T-Shirt and you want to be a part of something - but burnout is real and running and maintaining an open source project ios hard enough without having to deal with hundreds of non-constructive PRs. Dont let this put you off making a PR to a project if you are commiting something that really helps - but if you want to add 'Made With Love' or correct some spelling, maybe wait until this meaningless 'Hacktober' thing is over and do it on February 29th 2021.

In the meantime, please feel free to add ANYTHING you like to this repo. Nic Cage Gifs are most welcome. Also, I will open a number of issues each day and if you commit a PR that closes an issue, you can feel extra good.
